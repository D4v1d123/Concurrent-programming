## ðŸ“‚ Structure
The files in the **topics** folder correspond to the concepts of concurrent programming. Each file is divided into:
1. **Theory**: Located at the beginning of the file.
2. **Practical example**: Where the concepts discussed are applied.
>[!NOTE] 
The numbering of each file indicates the suggested order to learn the topics of concurrent programming.

## ðŸ“š Usage
1. Open the file corresponding to the topic you want to study.
2. Review the concepts explained in the header.
3. Analyze the practical exercise and relate it to the theory.
4. Run the file, observe the results in the console and compare them with your conclusions obtained by analyzing the exercise.
5. (Optional) Search a problem related to the topic on internet and try to solve it by applying the knowledge acquired.
