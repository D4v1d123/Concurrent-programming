# MAIN THREAD => It is the first thread that is created when the program is executed. 
# This thread executes the main code of the program and manages its central logic, in
# addition, it allows the creation of normal secondary threads and daemon threads. The 
# main thread is always a normal or non-daemon thread.

# SECONDARY THREADS => These are threads created by the main thread or another 
# secondary thread that run in the background to perform tasks or functions concurrently
# or in parallel.

# TYPES OF SECONDARY THREADS:

# * NORMAL OR NON-DAEMON THREADS => Threads that, upon completing the task for which 
# they were created, terminate their execution.
# * DAEMON THREADS => Threads that run in the background continuously, this with the aim 
# of listening to events (for example mouse clicks, network messages, etc) and perform 
# an action when these events happen. These threads start automatically when the program
# is open, and end their execution when the program is closed.
