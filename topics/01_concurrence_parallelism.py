# CONCURRENCY => It is the ability of a system to be able of handle multiple tasks at the same 
# time (not necessarily in parallel), intercalating their execution on the same CPU core.  

# PARALLELISM => It is the execution of two tasks at the same time or in parallel, this optimizes 
# the use of hardware resources and increases the software performance. For two or mare processes 
# to run at the same time, each must run on a CPU core.  

# PROCESS => It is the instance of a program with its own memory resource, CPU, permissions, date 
# input/output operation, all of them are assigned by the operating system.  

# THREADS => Known as threads or lightweight processes, they are tasks that can be executed in 
# parallel within the same process or program. Additionally, threads share the same memory space 
# with other threads.
