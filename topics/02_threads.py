# THREADS => They allow tasks or functions to be executed concurrently (in the
# background) with the aim of listening to events and performing an action or task in
# response to them. Reduce program execution time when there are multiple data input 
# and output operations because other tasks can be executed while waiting for those 
# operations to complete.

# On the other hand, threads can only be executed once (they cannot execute the same 
# task twice), and they share resources within the same process. Finally, a thread can
# create other threads within the same process.

# THREAD STATES:

# * READY => Thread created and ready to run.
# * RUNNING => Thread that is carrying out a task.
# * SUSPENDED OR BLOCKED => Thread waiting for a response or event, after which it 
# resumes to continue executing the task.
# * TERMINATED => Thread terminated, eliminating its execution context.

# start => Method that allows you to start the execution of a thread or task in the
# background.

# join => Method that suspends a thread until the execution of another specific thread 
# finishes to continue the execution of the program. It is used to synchronize the 
# execution of threads in a predefined order to avoid unexpected results.
