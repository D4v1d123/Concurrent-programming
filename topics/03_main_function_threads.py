# is_alive => Method that determines whether a thread is running (True) or not (false).
# It is used to analyze and debug the behavior of a program's threads , as well as 
# synchronize their execution. 

# active_count => Function that counts the amount of active (running) threads within a
# process. It is used to identify thread leaks, manage the creation of new threads 
# without exceeding an established limit, debug concurrent programs, etc. 

# THREAD LEAKS => These are unfinished or unnecessary threads that continue existing, 
# thus causing excessive consumption of system resources, making it unstable.

# enumerate => Function that generates a list of the threads (objects of the Thread 
# class) that are active with the objective of analyzing and debugging a program.

# main_thread => Function that obtains the object that identifies the main thread in a
# process or program. It is used to differentiate the main thread from secondary or 
# child threads.
